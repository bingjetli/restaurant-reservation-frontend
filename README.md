# Restaurant Reservation Frontend
This is the frontend client for the restaurant reservation system I created for Vu Restaurants as a portfolio project. This project was meant to serve as a learning experience and demonstration of using React Native to build mobile application frontends to interact with a REST API backend.

During my time spent on this project, I've gained experience with React Native through the Expo SDK to build a visually appealing frontend interface which also incorporates principles learned from 2014 Ellen Lupton's graphic design and typography textbook 'Type on Screen, A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Developers and Students'.

I have also gained experience with cross-platform mobile app creation through the Expo SDK which includes building and distributing production builds to their respective appstores.

This design of this application was inspired by Apple's Human Interface Guidelines to create an easy and intuitive user experience for the client.

# Features
- Full create/read/update/delete interactions with the backend.
- Main datepicker includes a toggle to view total reserved seats for each day.
- Carousel-style swipe gestures for both the main datepicker and reservation viewer.
- Auto-detects network changes and switches from using local or remote endpoints seamlessly allowing continued usage onsite without accessing the internet as well as remote usage offsite over the internet.
- Auto-detects duplicate entries when creating reservations prompting the user to either replace, ignore or cancel the action, mitigating duplicated entries due to human error.
- Allows time-off requests to be made by employees in a separate tab to be reviewed by management.
